With experience in CNC machining, prototyping, and material science, I have focused on enhancing product quality, performance, and cost-effectiveness. I apply Lean Manufacturing strategies to continuously improve production processes and projects to promote sustainable business growth.

I am seeking opportunities as a Mechanical Engineer, Product Design Engineer, or Project Engineer, where I can leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and international experience to drive innovation and efficiency. With a proven ability to collaborate in cross-functional teams and optimize engineering processes, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that align with business and industry objectives. Thank you for visiting!
